          <p>Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time<br>
              I feel alive and the world turning inside out Yeah!<br>

              So don't stop me now don't stop me<br>
              'Cause I'm having a good time having a good time<br></p>

          <p>I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky<br>
              Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity<br>
              I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva<br>
